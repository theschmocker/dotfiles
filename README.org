#+title: dotfiles

Very important text files.

Managed with GNU stow and/or manual symlinks.

* emacs
This is where most of the magic happens these days. General (Doom) Emacs configuration for software development, along with some custom Emacs (proto-)packages in varying states of completeness/usefulness.

I have a lot of fun tinkering with Emacs. Gives me a practical use-case to write Lisp and I get a text editor/computing environment that fits my brain and hands better over time out of it.
* nvim
Now that I work nearly full-time in Emacs, my Neovim configuration usually gets less attention.
* zsh/bash
When I'm not using eshell, I use zsh. Started with bash years ago, and just load my bash aliases into zsh. Nothing too fancy here -- mostly just path settings.
* .vsvimrc
When I have to use Visual Studio, this makes it more tolerable.
