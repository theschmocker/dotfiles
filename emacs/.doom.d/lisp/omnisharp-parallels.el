;; Some WIP code in here that attempts to start and connect to an OmniSharp
;; instance in Parallels while working with Blain Apps in a network share on the
;; macOS side.
;;
;; Working:
;; Modifying the :new-connection property of the OmniSharp client to
;; run "prlctl ..."
;;
;; Not working:
;; Basically everything else. OmniSharp starts (I think) but then exits
;; immediately with the error "The network path was not found." I've attempted
;; to encode various permutations of rootPath and rootUri, with no success so
;; far. Not sure that those are actually the issue, but those are the only
;; things like "network paths" I can see in the lsp logs. All that shows up is
;; the "initialize" request body that gets sent to OmniSharp. Would be helpful
;; if I could get my hands on OmniSharp's stdout, but the buffer that gets
;; created for the process is empty. Maybe the error is coming from something
;; other than OmniSharp ðŸ¤”.
;;
;; Alternatively, I could try running OmniSharp on the macOS side with Mono. I
;; /think/ Mono has some support for .NET Framework. Uncertain.
